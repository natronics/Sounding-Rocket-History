# <span class="small">Launch Site:</span>  Fort Churchill

**Fort Churchill** is a rocket launching complex located in Churchill, Manitoba. The site has been used on and off since the mid-1950s for sub-orbital launches of various sounding rockets during several major studies. The facility was some kilometres south of the now defunct military camp, Fort Churchill, and connected by an all weather gravel road. It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1988.
